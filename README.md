# Robot-Framework-Selenium-library
Implementation of Selenium library

Implemented a Robot Framework test that adds three cars to the car dealer web site. The test takes two 
screenshots of the car dealer site: one from the front page before cars are added and one after all cars 
have been added.
The website test container had no data persistence. Database is cleared every time the container is started.
